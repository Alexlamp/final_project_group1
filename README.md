# Final Project
Investigate criteria for profitable and risky airline based on air traffic at SFO. 
## “Circle”
### Objective: Design and conduct ETL process. Create schema data base.
* Success criteria: design tables that can show the cost and relative earnings of the air lines
### Status: 
* Created program that imports the air traffic data downloaded previously to the Resource folder  
* After the data was imported into data frames the programs conducts cleaning process by removing irrelevant columns, and rows with missing data.
* After two major data frames #SFO_Passanger_statistics and #SFO_Landing_statistics were cleaned the program joints them into one, #SFO_data_df ,  and cleaned
* The major data frame #SFO_data_df contains all metrics used for calculating airline gain: number of passengers per month, total number of flights, total weight etc. 
* Based on , Fleet_Dat.csv, dataset the software creates data frame that contains the list of all the airlines that land at SFO. The #airline_fleet_cost dataframe  contains the number, age and cost of all the aircrafts that each airline has
