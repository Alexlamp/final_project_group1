## Communication Protocols

Our group colaborates using two methods of telecommunication. Our primary method of communication, Zoom video conferencing, and our secondary method, Slack direct messaging. Twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday nights, we work together in breakout sessions over Zoom. On Tuesday nights we reflect on significant issues and accomplishments that occurred over the weekend and since our previous meeting. We identify opportunities for improvement and assign responsibilities for the upcoming week. We utilize Thursday night Zoom conferences to check the progress of our group member's and to set milestones going into the following week to make sure we are on track. daily on slack, Zoom meeting 2 times a week. Other feedback through out the week ad-hoc collaboration evenings and weekends.
